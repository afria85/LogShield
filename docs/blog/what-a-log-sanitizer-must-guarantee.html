<p>Most advice about log sanitization boils down to "run a regex" or "don't share logs." Neither survives contact with real workflows. People will share logs under pressure, and ad-hoc scripts break the moment log formats change.</p>

<p>I've found it more useful to think in terms of guarantees. If a sanitizer can't guarantee the basics, it's not safe to automate and it's hard to trust.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 1: Deterministic output</h2>

<p>Same input in, same output out. Every time.</p>

<p>This matters because it's the difference between a tool you can wire into CI and a tool you only dare to use manually. If a sanitizer is probabilistic or time-dependent, you can't build reliable workflows around it.</p>

<p>I've written about this before, but it's worth repeating: determinism is not a nice-to-have. It's what makes a tool trustable in production.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 2: Local-first processing</h2>

<p>Logs are sensitive by default. If sanitization requires sending raw logs to a remote service, you've created a new leak surface.</p>

<p>Local-first doesn't mean "never use cloud services." It means the default, safest path is to process logs locally, and you can prove that nothing is transmitted.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 3: Reviewability</h2>

<p>A sanitizer shouldn't be a black box. At minimum, you need to be able to answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>What types of secrets were detected?</li>
<li>How many redactions happened?</li>
<li>Where did they occur (roughly), without leaking the secret itself?</li>
</ul>

<p>In LogShield, this is why <code>--dry-run</code> exists:</p>

<pre><code><span class="code-comment"># Human review</span>
<span class="code-cmd">cat</span> <span class="code-file">app.log</span> <span class="code-pipe">|</span> <span class="code-cmd">logshield</span> scan <span class="code-flag">--dry-run</span>

<span class="code-comment"># Machine-readable review (safe to archive in v0.5.0+ because output is empty)</span>
<span class="code-cmd">cat</span> <span class="code-file">app.log</span> <span class="code-pipe">|</span> <span class="code-cmd">logshield</span> scan <span class="code-flag">--dry-run</span> <span class="code-flag">--json</span></code></pre>

<p>The point is to let people verify behavior before they trust automation.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 4: Structure preservation</h2>

<p>Sanitized logs need to remain useful. In practice that means:</p>

<ul>
<li>don't corrupt JSON</li>
<li>don't destroy key names</li>
<li>don't remove entire lines unless you have to</li>
<li>keep enough context to debug</li>
</ul>

<p>If you redact a JSON value, keep keys and delimiters intact so parsers and dashboards keep working.</p>

<p>This is where most ad-hoc scripts fail. They "solve" leakage by deleting content, and the result isn't actionable.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 5: Bounded behavior (no surprises)</h2>

<p>In enterprise workflows, predictability matters more than cleverness. A sanitizer needs:</p>

<p>- stable exit codes (so CI can make decisions) - stable flag semantics (<code>--dry-run</code> must never modify output) - clear failure modes (invalid flags should error, not silently continue)</p>

<p>A practical contract looks like:</p>

<p>- exit code 0: command succeeded - exit code 1: detections found and <code>--fail-on-detect</code> was enabled - exit code 2: usage or runtime error (invalid flags, missing file, etc.)</p>

<p>If you can't write tests for the tool's behavior, you won't be able to operate it safely.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 6: Safe by default</h2>

<p>The default invocation needs to be the safest one that still works.</p>

<p>That usually means:</p>

<ul>
<li>no network calls</li>
<li>no configuration required to get meaningful redaction</li>
<li>no output formats that accidentally include raw secrets</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is subtle. In versions before v0.5.0, LogShield's <code>--dry-run --json</code> output included the raw input in the result object. If you serialized that to a log aggregator, you'd re-leak the secrets you were trying to detect. v0.5.0 fixes this by returning an empty output field in dry-run mode.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 7: Auditability (without retention)</h2>

<p>You need to be able to prove what happened without storing the raw logs.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<ul>
<li>machine-readable summaries that are safe to archive</li>
<li>counts and classifications (what types were detected)</li>
<li>no raw input echoed back in result objects</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the difference between "it probably worked" and "we can show what happened" during incident response.</p>

<h2>Guarantee 8: Maintainable rule set</h2>

<p>Secrets evolve. Detection rules need to keep up. But rule updates have to be governable:</p>

<ul>
<li>additive changes should be safe</li>
<li>breaking changes should be rare and explicit</li>
<li>regressions should be caught by fixtures</li>
</ul>

<p>If a tool can't change without surprises, teams stop updating it. That's a different kind of risk.</p>

<h2>A quick evaluation checklist</h2>

<p>When you evaluate any log sanitizer &mdash; including your own scripts &mdash; ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is output deterministic?</li>
<li>Is processing local-first?</li>
<li>Can I preview and review redactions?</li>
<li>Does it preserve structure and labels?</li>
<li>Are exit codes and errors stable?</li>
<li>Are results safe to serialize and store?</li>
<li>Is the rule set tested against real fixtures?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can answer "yes" to most of these, you're in reasonable shape.</p>
