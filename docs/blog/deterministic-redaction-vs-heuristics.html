<p>There's a seductive idea in security tooling: if we just make the detection smarter, we'll catch more secrets. Entropy analysis. Machine learning. Contextual scoring. These sound great in demos.</p>

<p>Then you try to use them during an incident at 2 AM, and everything falls apart.</p>

<p>I learned this the hard way when I experimented with an entropy-based secret scanner. It caught a leaked API key that my regex-based tool missed. Great, right? Except it also flagged random UUIDs, base64-encoded images in JSON responses, and a bunch of hex strings that turned out to be request IDs. The false positive rate made it unusable in automated workflows.</p>

<p>The tool was smarter. But it wasn't more helpful.</p>

<h2>The incident response test</h2>

<p>Here's the scenario that matters: it's late, something broke, and you need to share logs with your team (or worse, with a vendor's support team). You have minutes, not hours.</p>

<p>In that moment, you need to answer one question: "If I sanitize this log right now, will the output be safe to share?"</p>

<p>With deterministic redaction, the answer is yes or no based on explicit rules. You can review them. You can test them. You can diff two runs and understand what changed.</p>

<p>With heuristic detection, the answer is "probably, unless the model updated or the context shifted or the entropy threshold behaves differently on your log format."</p>

<p>That uncertainty kills adoption.</p>

<h2>What actually breaks during incidents</h2>

<p>I've been through enough post-mortems to see the pattern. Logs leak not because the detection failed, but because the workflow broke:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone bypasses the sanitizer because they're not sure what it will do.</li>
<li>A CI pipeline produces different outputs on consecutive runs, and nobody trusts it anymore.</li>
<li>The sanitized log gets diff-checked, but the diff is full of noise from probabilistic changes, so actual secrets slip through unnoticed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem isn't technical capability. It's operational trust.</p>

<h2>Audit trails need boring answers</h2>

<p>Compliance and audit workflows have a simple requirement: you need to explain what you did and prove it's repeatable.</p>

<p>That conversation looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Auditor:</strong> "How do you ensure logs don't contain credentials before they're shared?"<br></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>You:</strong> "We run LogShield with these rules, which are tested against these fixtures, and produce deterministic output."</blockquote>

<p>That's an answer you can defend.</p>

<p>Compare that to:</p>

<blockquote><strong>You:</strong> "We use an ML-based classifier that scores entropy and context, and it gets updated monthly."<br></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Auditor:</strong> "How do you validate the updates?"<br></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>You:</strong> "..."</blockquote>

<p>The second approach isn't wrong. It's just harder to audit. And in regulated environments, "harder to audit" often means "not approved."</p>

<h2>The practical middle ground</h2>

<p>I'm not saying heuristic detection is useless. I'm saying it belongs in a different layer.</p>

<p>The workflow I've settled on:</p>

<p>1. <strong>At the boundary (human sharing, CI artifacts):</strong> deterministic redaction.      Boring, predictable, reviewable.</p>

<p>2. <strong>In centralized storage (log aggregators, SIEM):</strong> add DLP with smarter detection if you want.</p>

<p>3. <strong>For policy enforcement:</strong> use the deterministic layer to fail builds or block uploads.</p>

<p>This way, the riskiest path (logs leaving your control) is protected by the most reliable control.</p>

<h2>When deterministic rules miss something</h2>

<p>This will happen. You'll find a secret format that your rules don't cover yet.</p>

<p>The correct response isn't to throw out determinism. It's to tighten the loop:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save the missed example (in a safe fixture, obviously).</li>
<li>Write a rule that catches it.</li>
<li>Add a test that proves the rule works.</li>
<li>Ship an update.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's how you grow coverage without losing predictability. The rule set evolves, but it evolves explicitly.</p>

<p>I maintain a growing test suite for LogShield that captures real leak patterns I've seen. When someone reports a false negative, I add it to the suite and update the rules. The next version catches it, and I can prove it with a test.</p>

<h2>A small example that matters</h2>

<p>Here's what dry-run mode looks like with deterministic redaction:</p>

<pre><code>$ <span class="code-cmd">cat</span> <span class="code-file">incident-logs.txt</span> <span class="code-pipe">|</span> <span class="code-cmd">logshield</span> scan <span class="code-flag">--dry-run</span>

<span class="code-cmd">logshield</span> (dry-run)
Detected 3 redactions:
  AUTH_BEARER     x1
  PASSWORD        x2

No output was modified.
Use without <span class="code-flag">--dry-run</span> to apply.</code></pre>

<p>That's it. No surprises. You know exactly what will be redacted before you commit to it.</p>

<p>Now imagine the same workflow with a probabilistic tool where the output might change between runs. You'd have to sanitize, inspect, re-sanitize, and hope nothing shifted. That adds friction, and friction kills adoption.</p>

<h2>The CI use case</h2>

<p>If you want to enforce "no secrets in CI artifacts," you need a workflow that's stable enough to trust:</p>

<pre><code><span class="code-cmd">cat</span> <span class="code-file">logs.txt</span> <span class="code-pipe">|</span> <span class="code-cmd">logshield</span> scan <span class="code-flag">--dry-run</span> <span class="code-flag">--fail-on-detect</span></code></pre>

<p>This exits with code 1 if any redaction is detected. The build fails. You fix the source of the leak.</p>

<p>That only works if the detection is deterministic. If it's probabilistic, you get flaky builds and teams start bypassing the check.</p>

<h2>What I'd recommend</h2>

<p>If you're building log sanitization into your workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start with deterministic rules for the sharing boundary.</li>
<li>Use dry-run mode to validate behavior before automating.</li>
<li>Add heuristic layers later, if you need them, in less critical paths.</li>
<li>Prioritize reviewability over cleverness.</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal isn't to catch every possible secret. The goal is to catch the ones that actually leak, in a way that teams will actually use.</p>

<p>Boring wins.</p>
